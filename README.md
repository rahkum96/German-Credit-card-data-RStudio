### About
##### Credit risk
The risk of loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual commitments is referred to as credit risk. If a business extends credit to its customers, there's a chance they won't pay their bills.

##### Types of Credit Risk
- A good risk investment is one that one believes will be profitable. The phrase is most commonly used to describe a loan given to a creditworthy individual or business. Good risks are thought to have a very high chance of being repaid.

- A loan that is unlikely to be repaid due to a poor credit history, low income, or other factors. A negative risk raises the lender's risk as well as the possibility of the borrower defaulting.
